# Robotics project - Braitenberg vehicle navigation

## Description

A Braitenberg vehicle has to navigate a maze using its on-board
camera.
The robot will move towards simple visual guides so to guide the robot
towards the exit.
The participant will learn how to control a mobile robot using computer
vision in Gazebo/ROS.

## Extension (2 people)
A vision model based on ML will be implemented to detect more
complex visual cues (objects).
Participants will learn how to implement and deploy a practical object
detection model within ROS architecture.
